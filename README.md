# LS-2102
These are my submissions to the assignments on Computational Biophysics offered by IISER Kolkata as a part of the 3 credit second year laboratory course.

We dealt with the following aspects-
- Estimation of diffusion coefficient by single particle tracking
- Estimating diffusion coefficient from computers simulations of molecular systems.
the codes of which have been separately uploaded as Diffusion-1 and Diffusion-2.
